## Important concepts

* directed networks

* weighted networks

* sorts, and their quantitites

* time

. . . 

discover __multiplex networks__


## Towards Clustering

* reciprocity

* assorativity

. . .

* discover hidden structures

## The directed network model

Theme: discover non-trivial relationships among countries 

look at how they trade and what they trade


## Weighted networks

The [BACI-CEPII dataset:](http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/publications/wp/abstract.asp?NoDoc=6112)

## Bipartite networks

The country-to-product network induces country-to-country and product-to-product relationships.

## Reconstruction

$$
C = M_{cp}\cdot M_{cp}^T
$$

$$
P = M_{cp}^T\cdot M_{cp}
$$

## Analysis of neighbours

For a node i, let $k_i$ be its degree.

For directed networks: $k_i = k_i^{in} + k_i^{out}$.

The distribution of degree $P(k)$ provides a signature of the network. 

The average degree is denoted $\langle k \rangle.$


## Reciprocity

For a given directed network, reciprocity is the probability that of having links in both directions between two vertices.

R measures how the economies of two countries become interconnected (or interdependent).

$$
r = \frac{L^\leftrightarrow}{L}
$$

$L^\leftrightarrow$: number of reciprocal links

$L$: total number of links.


## Assortativity

Do vertices tend to connect with those with similar/dissimilar degree? Compute

. . .

- the avg. degree of node $i$'s neighbors:

$$
K_{nn}(i) = \frac{\sum_{\langle ij\rangle} k_j}{k_i}
$$


. . .

- Next, the avg. $K_{nn}$ for the $n_d$ nodes which have degree $d$

$$
K_{nn}(d) = \frac{\sum_{i:k_i=d} K_{nn}(i)}{n_d}
$$

-----

$$
K_{nn}(d) = \frac{\sum_{i:k_i=d} K_{nn}(i)}{n_d}
$$

Are $d$ and $K_{nn}(d)$ close?

Does assortativity grow over time?


## Balassa's RCA 

The export matrix $M$ is an adjacency matrix which reprents a bipartite graph.

Each scalar value $M_{cp}$ corresponds to the aggregated export of product $p$ by country $c.$

We can compute fractional ownership of export, product by product. 

Many countries export coffee, so none really controls it. 

Italy exports 100\% of Bergamot oil (cfr. Prince of Wales tea). 

-----

The Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) is in controlling a high fraction of some product. 

$\sum_{p^\prime} M_{cp^\prime}$: total value of export by country $c$. 

. . .

$\textrm{RCA}_{cp} = \frac{\frac{M_{cp}}{\sum_{p^\prime} M_{cp^\prime}}}{\frac{\sum_{c^\prime} M_{c^\prime p}}{\sum_{c^\prime} \sum_{p^\prime} M_{c^\prime p^\prime}}}$
