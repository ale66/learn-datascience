# Rating and Ranking

## Motivations

the ability to  

- *rate* something (is this a warm day for June in London?), or to

- *rank* a set of elements  (which is the coldest day of the month?)

is part of Science and Engineering since before Data Science.

. . .

Rating & ranking is a good framework to introduce Data Science techniques of general value and wide applicability.

Sports R&R is both fun and a huge Data Science market!


-----

## Definition

A measure of value of the subject, as objective and replicable as possible.

. . .

E.g., temperature.


-----

Normally, abilities are

- __latent__

- hard to measure

- time-dependent

- place-dependent

Exercise: take the [Prof or Hobo?](http://www.proforhobo.com/) quiz!


-----

yet, abilities are also

- hard to *transcend* (revert-to-the-mean effect, RTTM)

- relatively easy to perceive and project


-----

## Example: Football

- hard to guess the single score $\Longrightarrow$ entertainment value

. . .

- easy for experts to guess the long-term effect $\Longrightarrow$ different levels of enjoyment; RTTM: Revert To The Mean effect

. . .

Low scoring creates __randomness__

<!-- -------------------- -->
# Formalisation

## 1-dimensional ranking

$P:$ players, $|P|=n$

$T:$ time instants

$r: P \times T \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$


-----

A given rating function $r$ creates a ranking ($\rho$) on a set:

$$
\rho: P \times T \rightarrow [1..n]
$$

$$
\rho(p, t) = k \leftrightarrow |\{p_j: r(p_j, t) \leq r(p_i, t)\}| = k
$$

. . .

$$
\delta(p_i, p_j, t) = |r(p_i, t)-r(p_j, t)|
$$

$\delta$ captures both similarity and distance


----

## multi-dimensional ranking

Multi-dim. rating:

$$
r_{multi}: P \times T \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d
$$

. . .

Often:

$$
r_{multi}(p_i,t) : f(r_1(p_i,t), \dots r_d(p_i,t))
$$

. . .

*Pareto dominance:*

$p_i$ dominates $p_j$ (at time t) if on every dimension $x$ 

$$
r_x(p_i,t) \ge r_x(p_j,t)
$$

# Rating in games


-----

## Ratings in games

- score-based games are better-suited to create ratings

. . .

- yet effect of time and hardness of the proposed test match could be hard to assess.


----

## Should games keep user ratings?

### Yes:

- feeling of improvement

. . .

- a gauge for new features

. . .

- leads to rankings:

  - better matchmaking $\Longrightarrow$ entertainment value

  - fraud/anomaly detection?


----

## No: game prowness as social ranking?

The spectacle is a social relation mediated by images, not a collection of images.

«Le spectacle n'est pas un ensemble d'images, mais un rapport social entre des personnes, médiatisé par des images»

[Guy Debord, La Société du spectacle (1967), Thèse 4]

. . .

- a reflection of US culture?

. . .

- a turn-off for people who don't feel competive?

- turns-off casual users?

<!-- ---------- -->
# Sport ranking/estimation

## Domain

- n teams play each other in a tournament

- final scores are recorded, e.g., Real Madrid--Borussia Dortmund: 2-0.

- predict the score for a match in the future.

. . .

-focus on predicting the score difference (eg, 2-0=2)


----

## Running example

![](./imgs/massey-1.png)

the win-loss balance and the points balance are second-level performance measures

they are not considered sufficient to create valuable ratings/rankings/predictions.


-----

## [In]credible Assumptions

1. to each team a __latent__ variable for *strength* is assigned

. . .

numerical __ratings__ determine a __ranking__ among teams (at t=end, so we can drop it)

and a prediction $Pr[a\rightarrow b] = \frac{\rho(a)}{\rho(a)+\rho(b)}$


-----

2. strength/rating is immutable during the tournament

3. teams play each other exactly once during the tournament

. . .

Now, consider the score difference in each match, say $i$ vs. $j,$ defined as $s_i - s_j$

Define $\mathbf{y}_{m\times 1}$ as the vector of all score differences in matches

Assume (assumption 4) that strength/rating imbalance determines score difference:

$$
r_i - r_j = s_i - s_j
$$


-----

$$
X_{m\times n}\cdot \mathbf{r}_{n\times 1} = \mathbf{y}_{m\times 1}
$$

. . .

\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
 0 & 0      & +1     & 0      & -1     & 0 \\
   & 0      & \ddots & \ddots &        & \\
   & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \\
   & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \\
   &        & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \\
 0 & -1     & 0      & +1     & 0      & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

$X_{m\times n}$ with $m>>n$ is overconstrained, no hope of finding a solution.

# Massey's ratings


-----

## Data preparation

Massey considered the equivalent formulation of

$$
X_{m\times n}\cdot \mathbf{r}_{n\times 1} = \mathbf{y}_{m\times 1}
$$

as

$$
X^T \cdot X \cdot \mathbf{r} = X^T \cdot \mathbf{y}
$$

Both sides are easier to work with.

On the right-and side, $X^T \cdot \mathbf{y}$ is the all-season points difference vector, called $\mathbf{p}.$ 

Notice that $\sum p_i=0$.


-----

On the left-hand side,

$$M_{n\times n}\ =\ X^TX$$

is squared, semidefinite and positive.

However, the rows sum to 0 and cols. are not independent: 0/$\infty$ solutions ensue...

M. also noticed that *M* has a fixed structure and does not need to be re-computed all the times.


-----

\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
 n-1 & 0      & -x     & 0      & -y     & 0 \\
	 & n-1    & \ddots & \ddots &        &   \\
	 & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots &    \\
	 & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots &   \\
	 &        & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \\
   0 & -z     & 0      & -w     & 0      & n-1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

$m_{i,i} = n-1$ is the numbers of games $i$ played, 

$m_{i,j}$ is the negation of the no. of matches between $i$ and $j:$ here all values are set to -1.


-----

-----

## Massey

1. drops the last row/match

2. replaces it with a row of 1s, and sets $p_n=0$

 (all ratings, positive and negative, will sum to 0)

$\overline{M} = M$ everywhere but for the last row which is full of  1s

$\overline{\mathbf{p}}$ is $\mathbf{p}$ everywhere but for the last el. $p_n = 0$.


-----

1. now $\overline{M}$ is non-singular and invertible

2. solves

$$\overline{M} \mathbf{r} = \overline{\mathbf{p}}$$

to obtain an approximated rating for the teams.

The MSE solution to Massey's formula is a form of  __regression.__

It can also be seen as $\mathbf{r} = (\overline{X^TX})^{-1} \overline{X^T \mathbf{y}}.$


-----

## Output

ratings sum to zero

values have no direct interpretation.

however, they effectively generate __a hierarchy.__

## Visualise the ranking

Ratings are not necessarily meaningful, as a result of the matrix preparation.

Rankings are meaningful:

# Conclusions


-----

## Points to focus on

- rating and rating is the fun side of Data Science!

. . .

- *latent* variables that represent *non-measurable* skills

- those leave in a __*feature space*__ possibly separated from the __*data space*__

- yet they may get a numeric estimate, and inform our predictions

- Massey regresses on the latent variables
